  <small> <strong> <p>   Four Artificial Intelligence Forms
Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of Integrative Biology and Computer Science and Technology at Michigan State University, explained in a 2016 article that AI can be classified into four forms, beginning with today 's common task-specific smart systems and progressing to non-existent sentient systems. The following categories are:</p></strong>
<p><strong><ins>reactive machine.</ins></strong> Such AI systems do not have memory, and are unique to the mission. An example of this is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that in the 1990s beat Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard and make predictions, but it can't use past experiences to inform future ones because it doesn't have memory.</p>
<p><strong><ins>Limited memory.</ins></strong> These AI systems have memory so past experiences can be used to inform future decisions. For self-driving cars some of the decision-making functions are built this way.</p>

<p><strong><ins>The mind Theory</ins></strong> is a term used in psychology. This means that when applied to AI, the program will have the emotional knowledge to realize the emotions. This type of AI can infer human intentions and predict behaviour, which is a ability required for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.</p>
<p> <strong> <ins>The self-awareness.</ins></strong> AI systems in this category have a sense of self which gives them awareness. Self-aware computers understand their own current state. There is no such form of AI as yet.</p>
