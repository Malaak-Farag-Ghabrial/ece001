<small> <strong> <p> Could robots think?   Alan Turing,
Mathematician Alan Turing changed history with one question: "Do machines think ?"</p> </strong>
 <p> Turing's speech about "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and the resulting Turing Test, set the basic purpose and vision of artificial intelligence. At its heart, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer the question Turing poses affirmative. It's the attempt at replicating or simulating human intelligence in computers. The expansive purpose of artificial intelligence has led to numerous questions and debates. So much so, that there is no universally accepted single field definition. The big limitation in defining AI as simply "building intelligent machines" is that it does not really explain what artificial intelligence is? </p>

So, artificial intelligence ( AI ), a digital computer or machine-controlled robot's ability to perform tasks typically associated with intelligent beings. The term is also applied to the project of developing systems endowed with human characteristic intellectual processes such as the ability to reason, to discover meaning, to generalize or to learn from past experience. After the digital computer's advancements in the 1940s, it has been shown that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks – such as finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess – with great skill. However, given continued improvements in computer processing speed and memory power, Until now, there are no systems that can balance human versatility across wider domains or in activities requiring a great deal of daily knowledge. On the other hand, certain programs have achieved the efficiency standards of human experts and professionals in performing specific tasks, such that artificial intelligence is used in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis in this restricted sense,computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition .</p>
