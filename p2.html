 <small><strong>  <p> There are many abilities that contribute to artificial intelligence and without them AI wouldn't be what we expect</p> </strong>
<strong><p><ins>Ability to sense </ins></strong>, directly correlates with object recognition. In this case, object recognition is to pick and identify objects from various inputs, such as videos and digital images. Natural Language Processing ( NLP) also contributes to sensitivity, which means the ability to read and make sense of text.</p>
<strong><p><ins>Ability To Converse </ins></strong>which is the ability to have a conversation, is the foundation for having the ability to think. This is summed up by Predictive Analytics by predicting the probability of future outcomes based on historical data and algorithms (machine learning).</p>
<strong><p><ins>Ability to learn</ins> </strong>, requires self-improvement automatically. Such changes not only need to happen, but we also need to consider how such improvements have been made as they occur.</p>
<strong><p><ins>the ability to act</ins></strong>, relates to thought about behavior. This is also known as "Prescriptive Analytics," and with defined criteria, it decides the best solutions / outcomes between different choices.</p></small>
